I have talked about the theory of the "Cloud desktop" twice on my older blog ([Rackspace's Hosted Virtual Desktop][1] and [More on the desktop in the cloud][2]) way back since 2011. Since then, a few things have changed:

* Amazon have released [AWS Workspaces][3], which is a cloud based desktop using [Teradici's PCoIP technology][4]
* Both [EC2][5] and [Azure][6] now have GPU enabled VMs to spin up and use
* NVidia have released [NVidia Grid cards][7], specifically for the "cloud" or "remote" desktop services.
* [Windows Continuum][8] now allows you to use your Windows Phone as with a keyboard, monitor and mouse, allowing you to replace your desktop
* and now [VMWare has just released a Windows UWP app that works with Continuum][9]

with all the increased bandwidth for mobile devices (4 and 5G, expanding wifi, etc) the idea of having your desktop live in the cloud is getting nearer...  interesting times, my friend... interesting times...
