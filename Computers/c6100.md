# Dell C6100 servers

I bought a [Dell C6100](http://www.dell.com/ie/business/p/poweredge-c6100/pd) a while back. 4 nodes, each with Dual [Xeon E5506](http://ark.intel.com/products/37096/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5506-4M-Cache-2_13-GHz-4_80-GTs-Intel-QPI) processors, 3 have 36Gb RAM and 1 has 72Gb. They share 12 drives bays (3 dedicated to each machine) and each machine has 2 GigE ports and an [IPMI port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface).

3 of the machines are running [Windows Server 2016](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/windows-server) and one is running Windows Server 1709, and have a mix of drives, mostly spare. I think 3 have a 250Gb Drive, one boots from a 750Gb disk, and 2 have 64Gb SSDs for extra space, one has a 500Gb for extra space. They all have Hyper-V enabled, managed by [SCVMM](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg610610%28v=sc.12%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396) and have both NICs connected to my main switch in teamed mode.

VMs hosted on them include:

* DHCP Server running on Windows Server 2016 Core
* 2 Active Directory boxes, currently running Windows Server 2012 R2, but soon to get upgraded to 2016 Core
* Linux VM running docker (with multiple containers)
* Linux VM for monitoring network
* Linux VM for [Ubiquiti Networks](http://www.ubnt.com) controller
